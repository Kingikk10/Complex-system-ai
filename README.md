# Complex-system-ai
Post mortem

	For the complex systems project, I decided to 

build an AI in The Unreal Engine 4. I first Started with 

an AI that would follow you if you walk into his cone of 

vision, and if you were not in that cone he would wonder. 

I then swapped to using a black board to set up a AI 

tree.The Tree branches allowing the ai to swap between 

wandering, seeing a player and chasing, than back to 

wandoer. the ai also remembers the last location it saw 

you and will move to that spot.
	
	There are not very many diffrent tutorials on how 

to do the blackboard style ai, so it was hard to get 

diffrent ways of accomplishing the same thing. The 

tutorial was out of date so i had to find little work 

arounds on certian nodes.

	this should be a good base for an ai system for 

further experimenting.
